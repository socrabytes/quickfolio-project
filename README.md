We use GitHub issues to track all tasks. When creating issues:

2. Add to the project board
3. Apply relevant labels
4. Link to related issues/PRs

### Branch Management

- Create branches using: `[type]/[issue-number]-[description]`
  - Example: `feat/1-custom-domain-wizard`
- Types:
  - `feat/` - New features
  - `fix/` - Bug fixes
  - `refactor/` - Code improvements
  - `docs/` - Documentation
  - `test/` - Testing improvements

### Pull Request Process

1. Create PR with detailed description
2. Link to related issue
3. Request reviews if needed
4. Merge with simple merge commit
5. Delete branch after merge

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention:
